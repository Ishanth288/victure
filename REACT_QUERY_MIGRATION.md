# React Query Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted data fetching from manual Supabase queries in React contexts to React Query hooks, enabling automatic parallelism and caching.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created React Query Hooks

#### `useBillsQuery(userId)`
- **Location**: `src/hooks/queries/useBillsQuery.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Fetches bills with related prescriptions and bill items
  - Transforms data to include both raw bills and prescription bills
  - Automatic caching with 5-minute stale time
  - Parallel execution with inventory query
  - Proper error handling and loading states

#### `useInventoryQuery(userId)`
- **Location**: `src/hooks/queries/useInventoryQuery.ts` 
- **Features**:
  - Fetches inventory items for the user
  - Type-safe data transformation
  - Automatic caching with 5-minute stale time
  - Parallel execution with bills query
  - Proper error handling and loading states

### 2. Converted Contexts to Thin Wrappers

#### `BillingContext`
- **Before**: Complex state management with manual Supabase queries
- **After**: Thin wrapper around `useBillsQuery` hook
- **Benefits**:
  - Removed waterfall effect - bills now load in parallel with inventory
  - Automatic caching and background refetching
  - Simplified state management
  - Preserved all existing API for backward compatibility

#### `InventoryContext`
- **Before**: Complex state management with manual Supabase queries  
- **After**: Thin wrapper around `useInventoryQuery` hook
- **Benefits**:
  - Removed waterfall effect - inventory now loads in parallel with bills
  - Automatic caching and background refetching
  - Simplified state management
  - Preserved all existing API for backward compatibility

### 3. Key Benefits Achieved

#### Automatic Parallelism
- Bills and inventory queries now execute concurrently
- Eliminates the "waterfall" effect where one query waits for another
- Faster initial page loads

#### Smart Caching
- React Query automatically caches results for 5 minutes
- Background refetching keeps data fresh
- Reduces unnecessary API calls

#### Better Error Handling
- Centralized error handling in query hooks
- Automatic retry logic (2 retries for queries, 1 for mutations)
- Better user experience during network issues

#### Simplified State Management
- Contexts are now thin wrappers focused on UI state
- Data fetching logic is centralized in query hooks
- Easier to test and maintain

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- All existing context APIs remain unchanged
- Components using `useBilling()` and `useInventory()` work without modification
- Realtime subscriptions still work for live updates
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 5. Performance Improvements
- Reduced time to first meaningful paint
- Better perceived performance through parallel loading
- Automatic background updates keep data fresh
- Reduced bundle size through simplified context logic

## Configuration
React Query is configured in `src/main.tsx` with:
- 2 retries for failed queries
- 1 retry for failed mutations
- 5-minute stale time for cached data
- 10-minute garbage collection time
- Window focus refetching disabled for better UX

## Next Steps
The migration is complete and maintains full backward compatibility. The application now benefits from React Query's powerful caching and parallel execution features while preserving all existing functionality.
