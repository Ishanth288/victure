## üõ† Technical Implementation Details

### App Initialization (`src/App.tsx`)
```typescript
// Auto-initialize performance optimizations
useEffect(() => {
  const cleanupMobile = autoInitializeMobileOptimizations();
  const cleanupNetwork = setupNetworkMonitoring();
  
  return () => {
    cleanupMobile();
    cleanupNetwork();
  };
}, []);
```

### Real-Time Optimization Usage
```typescript
// Create optimized subscription
const cleanup = createOptimizedSubscription(
  'inventory_updates',
  'inventory_items',
  userId,
  (payload) => {
    // Handle real-time updates
  }
);
```

### Dashboard Data with Caching
```typescript
// Enhanced dashboard hook with caching
const {
  totalRevenue,
  totalInventoryValue,
  isLoading,
  connectionStatus
} = useDashboardData();
